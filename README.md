This is [g-sorcery](https://github.com/jauhien/g-sorcery) backend for elisp packages.


# Installation

```
emerge -va gs-elpa
```

# Usage

There are two ways of using **gs-elpa**

## Using gs-elpa with [layman](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Layman)

It the the recommend way and I strongly suggest it.

Then you should just run `layman -L` as
root and find an overlay you want. Type of overlay will be
displayed as *g-sorcery*. Then you add this overlay as
usually and emerge packages you want. Always add gnu-elpa overlay first,
as other overlays depend on it.

It's all you need to do. Example:

```
layman -L
layman -a gnu-elpa
layman -a melpa-stable
emerge -va clojure-mode
```

There are 3 gs-elpa overlays currently: [gnu-elpa](https://elpa.gnu.org/), [marmalade](https://marmalade-repo.org/),
[melpa](https://melpa.org/) and [melpa-stable](https://stable.melpa.org/).

When using **gs-elpa** with layman you can populate overlay only with packages you want.
To do so you should add a section named gs-elpa to */etc/g-sorcery/g-sorcery.cfg*.
In this section you can add entries named REPO_packages (REPO here is the name
of repository you want to add) which are space separated lists of packages you need. ebuilds for
dependencies will be generated automatically if backend supports this possibility.

```
[main]
package_manager=portage

[gs-elpa]
marmalade_packages = clojure-mode clojurescript-mode
```
Note, that some overlays may depend on other overlays, in this case you'll need to add those
dependencies first (always add the whole gnu-elpa overlay).


## Using gs-elpa as stand-alone tool

In this case you should create an overlay (see **portage** documentation), sync it and populate
it with one or more ebuilds. Then ebuilds could be installed by emerge or by **gs-elpa** tool.
This is not the recommended way and may be removed in the future.

Create new user overlay:

```
gs-elpa -o $OVERLAY_DIRECTORY -r gnu-elpa sync
```

List packages:

```
gs-elpa -o $OVERLAY_DIRECTORY -r gnu-elpa list
```

Install any package you want:

```
gs-elpa -o $OVERLAY_DIRECTORY -r gnu-elpa install $PACKAGE
```

Repositories you can use are gnu-elpa, marmalade, melpa and melpa-stable. You can use them
all in one overlay. Note, that if you call **generate-tree** command your overlay
will be wiped and overlay tree for a given repository will be generated. Be careful!

See man page of **gs-elpa** for further information.

## Notes

* **Generation of packages already available in the portage tree**:
    Ebuilds for the packages available in the tree are excluded from
    the generation. To enable their generation you need to edit
    `/etc/g-sorcery/gs-elpa.json` file: remove packages you need
    from the `exclude` list in the `common_config` inside this config file.

* **Excluding packages from dependencies**:
    If you ever find bugs like [this one](https://github.com/jauhien/gs-elpa/issues/6),
    you can exclude packages from dependencies adding their name to the "external" object
    in the "common-config" section of `/etc/g-sorcery/gs-elpa.json` config file.
    For the example issue it would be (together with already added packages):

	"external": {"emacs": "virtual/emacs", "cl-lib": "virtual/emacs", "eieio": "virtual/emacs"}
